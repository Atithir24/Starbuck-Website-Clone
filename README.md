# Starbuck-Website-Clone
 I built a Starbucks website clone to improve my web development skills. This project taught me responsive design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on Flexbox, Grid, and media queries. I also learned how to apply branding, animations, and dynamic elements to create an engaging, user-friendly experience.
